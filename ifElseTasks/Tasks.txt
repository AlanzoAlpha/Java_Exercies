1.Create a method which accepts 3 parameters, 2 integers and a boolean.

If the boolean is true, the method will return a sum of the two numbers, and it if is false it will return the multiplication of the two numbers.
For example:

Input (1, 2, true) -> 3
Input (3, 3, false) -> 9
Input (1, 1, true) -> 2

2. Recreate the following flowchart as a project. Ensure that your logic and outputs match that of the flowchart.

3. (Black Jack) Given 2 integer values greater than 0, return whichever is closest to 21 without going over 21. If they both go over 21 then return 0.
